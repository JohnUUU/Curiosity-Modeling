# Curiosity-Modeling
1. What are you trying to model? Include a brief description that would give someone unfamiliar with the topic a basic understanding of your goal. 

        We wanted to model the variety of different android lock patterns for the 3x3 lock screen. More specifically we're interested in modeling the "Max Complexity" locks that require every dot to be used and all slopes between dots are distinct. This project was inspired by https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKjbBQ0PBCQ 

2. Give an overview of your model design choices, what checks or run statements you wrote, and what we should expect to see from an instance produced by the Sterling visualizer. How should we look at and interpret an instance created by your spec? Did you create a custom visualization, or did you use the default?

3. At a high level, what do each of your sigs and preds represent in the context of the model? Justify the purpose for their existence and how they fit together.

4. In addition to the README be sure to document your model and test files.

        The Max Complexity Lock Model is in curiosity_model.frg, the Tests are in curiosity_model.tests.frg, and the Custom Visualizer is in curiosity_model_vis.js. Please Note that the custom visualizer uses Canvas and not Div.
